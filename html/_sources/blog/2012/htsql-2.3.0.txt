This is the first release in the 2.3 development series.  This release
is focused almost exclusively on licensing and packaging changes. 

With this release, HTSQL is now free and open source software under the
terms of the AGPLv3.  That said, we're keeping our permissive license so
that proprietary applications could use HTSQL in conjunction with open
source databases.  For more detail, visit http://htsql.org/license/.

We've re-packaged HTSQL so that each database adapter has its own source
and binary package.  This permits us to specify dependencies, for
example, ``HTSQL-PGSQL`` explicitly requires the ``pyscopg2`` database
client software for PostgreSQL.  This packaging also permits us to
clarify that adapters to proprietary databases are not free software. 

Going forward, we're switching to an even/odd release numbering scheme.
Each public release is marked by three numbers, ``X.Y.Z``.  Here ``X.Y``
are the major/minor version numbers and ``Z`` is the release number.  An
even (odd) value of ``Y`` indicates a stable (development) release
series respectively.  Thus ``2.3.0`` starts a new series of development
releases, which will conclude with the ``2.4.0`` stable series.  Our
stable releases are targeted to long term support and maintain syntax,
semantics, and API compatibility when ever possible.

Finally, we've updated our website and introduced a new mascot!

Specific changes since the 2.2 final release:

* Extracted connection pooling into a separate addon ``tweak.pool``
  since it was causing issues with SQLite and MySQL backends.
* Added a quick start guide, :doc:`/doc/handbook`, and added a "Philosophy"
  section to our :doc:`/doc/overview`.
* Added ``describe`` command to ``htsql-ctl shell``.
