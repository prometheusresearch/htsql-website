This is the initial beta release: not all features work as specified and some
are not implemented yet.

Two backends are supported: PostgreSQL and SQLite.  The PostgreSQL backend
is more feature-complete.

The SQL translator needs more work: term compiler, the frame assembler and
the SQL serializer are of alpha quality.

Many functions from the standard library are not yet implemented or missing
a proper serializer, especially for the SQLite backend.
