The first release candidate for the 2.1 release is now available.
Changes since the last beta:

* Added `/:tsv` formatter that generates output in tab-separated format
  (thank to Andrey Popp).
* A lot of updates to the tutorial, the reference and other documentation.
* Minor code updates and bug fixes.

The documentation changes include:

1. We completely revamped the `HTRAF Toolkit Reference
   <http://htsql.org/htraf/index.html>`_.

2. We revisited the `Tutorial <http://htsql.org/doc/tutorial.html>`_,
   editing most sections and adding two new sections that describe 2.1
   features: `Calculations & References <http://htsql.org/doc/tutorial.html#calculations-references>`_, 
   `Projections <http://htsql.org/doc/tutorial.html#projections>`_.

3. We revisited the `Overview <http://htsql.org/doc/overview.html>`_,
   which now includes two new sections: 
   `HTSQL in a Nutshell <http://htsql.org/doc/overview.html#htsql-in-a-nutshell>`_, 
   `Why not SQL? <http://htsql.org/doc/overview.html#why-not-sql>`_.

4. We started work on a `Reference <http://htsql.org/doc/reference.html>`_.

5. We added a `Gallery <http://htsql.org/gallery/index.html>`_ with
   examples of HTSQL queries and HTRAF dashboards for several datasets.

Major changes since the 2.0 release:

* Added *MySQL*, *Oracle* and *MS SQL Server* backends, in addition to
  existing *SQLite* and *PostgreSQL* backends.
* Added support for projections (see :doc:`introducing-projections`).
* Added support for calculated attributes and references (see
  :doc:`introducing-calculated-attributes` and
  :doc:`introducing-references`).
* Streamlined HTSQL grammar and semantics, added support for `time` and
  `datetime` data types, and many other improvements.
