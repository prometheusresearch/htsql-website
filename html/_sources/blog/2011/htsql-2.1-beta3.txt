A new beta of the 2.1 release is now available.

Changes since the last beta:

* Added a fiber linking operator; see :ref:`roadmap-linking-operator`.
* Provide named attributes for kernel expressions and the complement
  link in a quotient scope; for more details, see
  :ref:`roadmap-projection-namespace`.
* Added in-selector definitions; see :ref:`roadmap-selector-shortcuts`.
* Added `$reference` syntax for inter-scope references; for more
  details and rationale, see :ref:`roadmap-references`.
* Added flow method `fork()`: clone the last node in the flow, e.g.
  `/course?credits=max(fork().credits)`.
* Added flow methods `.filter()` and `.select()` as aliases to `?`
  and `{}` operators.
* Added method `distinct()`: `distinct(table{kernel})` produces
  a flow of unique values of `kernel` as it runs over `table`;
  it is equivalent to `table^kernel`.  `distinct()` and `^` operators
  now filter out NULL values in the kernel.
* Changed semantics of `.` and `{}` expressions: specifier (`.`)
  now allows arbitrary expressions on both sides, selector (`{}`)
  now sets the output columns in the current scope.
* Added syntax `*N`, where `N` is an integer literal, to get the value
  of the `N`-th output column.
* Added addon `tweak.cors`: append `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *`
  to every HTTP response.
* Added addon `tweak.pgsql.inet`: basic manipulations on values
  of `INET` data type.
* Added addon `tweak.pgsql.view`: determine foreign key relationships
  for views in Postgresql.
* Use `search_path` or its analogues to choose a table when
  the table name is ambiguous.
* Optimized introspection for Oracle.
* Added option `-p` to ask for a password on startup.
* Added shell command `run filename.htsql` to load and execute
  an HTSQL query from a file.
* Many other fixes and documentation updates.
