The theme for HTSQL 2.2 is "Form Applications".
Our focus for this release will be on functionality
gaps that hinder use of HTSQL by developers to
create Javascript based "CRUD" applications. 

.. blogcut::

Overview
--------

This release will include plugin configuration,
schema introspection, custom commands, CRUD
operations, and general support for Javascript
applications such as HTRAF Forms.

This roadmap has 5 milestones.

* Plugin Configuration & Introspection
* Commands & Query Structure Analysis
* Identifiers & Record Locators
* Record-Based CRUD Operations
* Transactions & Data Handling
* Catalog Extensions & Capstone

A secondary focus for this release, as time
permits, will be adding usability improvements such
as better error handling and adding new data types
or functions.

Milestone A : Plugin Configuration & Introspection
--------------------------------------------------

The first milestone for HTSQL 2.2 will support
configuration for plugins and a mechanism to obtain
metadata from a Javascript application.  This work
is expected to enable the construction of a visual
query builder and other complementary tools.  The
milestone includes several deliverables:

1. mechanism for plugins and plugin arguments so 
   that HTSQL tweeks can be customized without 
   having to alter source code for each client
2. configuration file mechanism (YAML) so plugin
   parameters can be specified without programming
3. simplified metadata introspection so Javascript
   applications can list tables, links and columns
4. documentation for 1-3

One immediate use of this deliverable will be a
sample plugin to enable SQLAlchemy users to use
their model configuration to specify primary and
foreign key constraints.

Milestone B : Commands & Query Structure Analysis
-------------------------------------------------

This milestone create a way to define custom 
commands and introspect the structure of an HTSQL 
query.  It is expected that this deliverable would 
enable client side Javascript to dynamically build 
a form based on a query.

1. create a mechanism to define and invoke commands
2. create a way to decorate fields in a selector
3. create a command to introspect a query 

This milestone is needed to build forms dynamically.

Milestone C : Identifiers & Record Locators
-------------------------------------------

This milestone introduces a mechanism to identify
individual records via primary key values without
requiring the key column names be listed.  This
simplifies user interface construction and enables
record-based commands to be added.  This includes:

1. adding ``id()`` function and associated data
   type that returns a unique identifier for a 
   given record in the database
2. adding the locator syntax to accept a single
   record identifier and uses it to return exactly 
   one row during selection

This milestone is a requirement for basic CRUD
operations and enables single-record access.

Milestone D : Record-Based CRUD Operations
------------------------------------------

This milestone will be an optional plugin with a
full set of record-based operations for INSERT,
UPDATE and DELETE.  These additional commands will
permit CRUD applications to be written on top of
HTSQL that do more than query the database. 

1. single record ``insert``, ``update``, and
   ``delete`` commands that use record locators

This first pass of CRUD operations will only be
available to databases that support ``RETURNING``.

Milestone E : Transactions & Data Handling
------------------------------------------

This milestone will address how to pass nested data
sets to the server and introduce ways to
communicate between commands.  

1. support for JSON literal values to pass nested
   data structures from client to server
2. a transaction mechanism ``do()`` to group
   multiple record operations
3. a way to pass data from one command to another
   using variables and control structures
4. a ``foreach`` command to loop over record 
   sequences and nested data sets

This milestone will enable sophisticated 
backend processing and master/detail forms.

Milestone F : Catalog Extensions & Capstone
-------------------------------------------

This is the final milestone of the release and will
fill gaps identified by users building applications
using HTSQL.  In particular, it may include support
for custom catalog extensions so that form builders
can augment meta-data with configured screen
labels.  It will probably also include query
manipulation commands, such as stripping selectors
or replacing a filter.

1. support for custom catalog extensions
2. query manipulation operations
3. updating documentation, website & materials

This deliverable will likely be modified heavily
based on what's needed to deliver HTRAF Forms.
