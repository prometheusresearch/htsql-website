This is a development status update for HTSQL 2.1, including a
statement of scope, notes on projections, database backends and
numerous other features that we're currently working on.

Release Scope
-------------

The scope for the HTSQL 2.1 release is defined primarily around an
end-user deliverable -- the ability to succinctly translate a sample of
complex SQL queries from the financial industry.  Along these lines, the
primary gaps in HTSQL that we identified were:

 * support for *projections*, the ability for a each row in the result
   to represent distinct values from a set of expressions; 
 
 * support for *detachment*, so that we can compare a row-value of
   a column to an aggregate on that same column;

 * support for *macros*, parameterized logic fragments that can be 
   declared once and re-used several times in a given query; and

 * an optimization phase so that sets of similar aggregate expressions
   can be converted into a single subquery frame using conditional logic
   instead of requiring a subquery for each aggregate.
  
Besides this core objective, we have several internal refactor goals:

  * review semantics of ``select`` and ``filter`` operators and
    provide a functional syntax equivalent to aid composability;
    
  * review name lookup rules and mechanisms to refer to components
    from prior query contexts

Finally, because of user feedback, we added two more objectives:

  * support for ``datetime`` data type and corresponding operators;

  * support for MySQL, Oracle and MS SQL Server backends.

We also intend to expand the documentation -- many features in the 2.0
release weren't documented.  We hope to fill in this gap and document all
of the new features we're introducing.  

While there are lots of other things we could have put in this release,
it's already too big, so many other high-value features will wait for
the next release.  Two features we will reluctantly omit are:

  * a mechanism to override the HTSQL catalog to exclude/rename tables
    and other introspected meta-data objects;

  * any sort of introspection, ie, listing tables available in HTSQL,
    or columns that you can in the database;

In short... due to feature creep, this release is quite substantial and
will take some time to specify, complete, document and test.

Current Status
--------------

At this point, support for projections, macros, and other backends is
implemented -- but all of these features lack documentation and full
regression coverage tests.  We also reviewed name lookup rules (to
support macros) and have adjusted the implementation to support new
behavior that is required.

What's up next is documentation for projections and macros, support
for datetime/timestamp, and several other features and changes.

Finally, we've added the optimization phase to the translator, but it
doesn't yet perform the specific query transformation we have in mind.
This, other optimizations and refactors after low-level code review 
will take the final month of the release cycle.
