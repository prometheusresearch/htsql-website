The first release candidate for the 2.2 release is now available.
The primary change from the last beta is the introduction of a 
new `tweak.override` addon which provides detailed control over
the database metadata:

* restrict access to particular tables and columns
* configure missing unique and foreign keys
* change table, column and link labels
* define calculated fields 

The other major change is auto completion of table, column and link
names in the htsql-ctl shell and the web-based editor.  We also added
a `@` scope reset operator.  Finally, we now have binary packages
for Debian and RedHat GNU/Linux systems.
