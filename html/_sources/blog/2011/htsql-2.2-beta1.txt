The first beta of the 2.2 release is now available.

The new release brings two major features:

* a mechanism to query HTSQL's system catalog
* a query editor for the web /w syntax highlighting

We've tagged 2.2.0 beta #1, our first installment on the 
road to supporting "form applications".  Here are the
major new features we've added:

* a web-based ``/shell()`` command for interactive multi-line 
  HTSQL query editing with syntax highlighting

* a ``/meta()`` command that can be used to return accessible
  tables, links and columns

* added plugin parameters and configuration file support

* defined a command mechanism as a way to include 
  functionality unrelated to SQL generation

* converted formatters to use new command mechanism

All of these features are enabled at http://demo.htsql.org

The ``/meta()`` command changes the execution context to run
queries on the system catalog: ``table``, ``field``, ``column``
and ``link``.  For example,

.. htsql:: /meta(/table)

.. htsql:: /meta(/link?table_name='department')

In addition to new features, we have one important bug
fix.  There is a silent data truncation error that can 
be triggered with character encoding issues (reported
by Gordon... thank you!).  SQLite users should upgrade.
