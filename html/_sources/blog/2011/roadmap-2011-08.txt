This month we improved the generated SQL for projections and
multiple-aggregates.  We intend to release 2.1-FINAL this
month, after additional code cleanup and documention work.
Additionally, we're scoping features for 2.2, including
configuration files, plugin parameters, commands, introspection, 
catalog extensions, and record-based CRUD operations.
