This is the final release of HTSQL 2.1 aka "Query Power".  This release
focuses on supporting analytical queries with projections and calculated
attributes.

Major changes since the 2.0 release:

* Added *MySQL*, *Oracle* and *MS SQL Server* backends, in addition to
  existing *SQLite* and *PostgreSQL* backends.
* Added support for projections (see :doc:`introducing-projections`).
* Added support for calculated attributes and references (see
  :doc:`introducing-calculated-attributes` and
  :doc:`introducing-references`).
* Streamlined HTSQL grammar and semantics, added support for `time` and
  `datetime` data types, and many other improvements.

Changes since 2.1rc1 include:

* General code cleanup and refactoring.
* Improved emitted SQL for projections and aggregates.
* Changed operator precedence to avoid parentheses around
  filtering and projection operators.
* Added a test data generator for HTSQL regression tests
  (thank to Yuri Yerokhin).
* Added support for hierarchical headers for `/:txt` and `/:html`
  formatters.
