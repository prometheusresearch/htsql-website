The final release for 2.2 series is now available.  This release 
was focused on usability improvements, metadata functionality gaps, 
and better Python integration.  In this release we include:

* support for configuration files and plugin parameters
* a web-based query editor with highlighting & auto-completion (`tweak.shell`)
* a *meta* database for querying tables, columns and links (`tweak.meta`)
* integration with Django and SQLAlchemy (`tweak.django`, `tweak.sqlalchemy`)
* an API for making parameterized queries from Python applications
* improved database introspection, error messages, and usability fixes
* binary packages for Debian and RHEL

We also added a `tweak.override` plugin to provide granular control 
over the introspected database catalog; this plugin allows you to:

* restrict access to particular tables and columns
* provide missing unique and foreign key constraints
* change table, column and link labels
* define calculated fields and table methods

Specific changes since the last release candidate:

* Updated API for making HTSQL requests from Python application.
* Improved error messages; added suggestions for lookup errors.
* `tweak.override`: added support for global functions and
  parameterized calculations.
