This is a brainstorm topic on catalog structure, extensions, and access.
On startup, HTSQL introspects the database to find catalog information.
Sometimes this information needs to be augmented with additional detail,
including missing information, renaming links, providing for calculated
attributes and custom application data.

Basics
------

So, by Catalog we mean both the API for access and
internal Entities: currently Schema, Table & Column.

There are two aspects.  Structurally, Plugins can add
entities and attributes of entities.  The content of
the Catalog structure would be db introspection,
catalog configuration overrides, or converters from
ORMs such.

At the HTSQL level, we're assuming an unmanaged,
product based approach with YAML configuration.  We
are leaving it to framework adapters and higher-level
automation tools to make it more "user friendly".

The catalog that is configured & used to generate SQL
is not the same information that is returned by an
introspection operation.  Although they are tightly
related.  Since you can't access SQL entities
directly via HTSQL, it makes no point to permit them
to be queried.

Instead, the introspection model consists of nodes 
and arcs.  In this view, a "table" is really an arc
from the root node to an node representing the given
table; a foreign key from a table to another table
is also an arc, creating a unified model.  Columns
are encapsulated as node attributes, and actual
database type of a column is only realized via the
HTSQL Domain. 
  


Example: Column Label
---------------------

For example, let's take a column label attribute that
would be attached to the Column entity.  This would
be kind of "entity plugin", it would override the
construction of Column objects to add the ``label``
attribute.  This plugin would also have its own
configuration file that would *override* any
"introspected" values.  We'd imagine this would
simply be a mapping of ``schema.table.column``
identifiers onto the actual labels.  Perhaps tedious,
but functional and obvious.

It would then be the task of any introspector plugin
to fill in this ``label`` attribute if it knew of a
strategy to do so.  For example a Django configurator
that would run instead of the default introspector
might grab the title from the corresponding ORM
Entity objects.  We assume that there wouldn't be
more than one configurator plugin active.


Use Cases
---------

*Calculations*

  How do we add a calculation to the server?  We
  could have it be done via configuration only, but
  this would limit it only to administration.  This
  could be done via a UserCalc plugin that uses YAML
  and/or SQLite storage; then on restart/refresh load
  them.  How do we do this incrementally?

*Extra Attributes*

  User interface tools may wish to add attributes, such
  as a column label or coordinates for layout.  How are
  these stored, updated, queried, etc.

*Extra Structures*

  One may even wish to have new structures, such as ``layout``
  with relations to other entities.  Another example of 
  this may be additional full-text search data which 
  may need to augment existing catalog data.


Concerns
--------

*Refresh*

   Do we have any way to update the catalog at runtime 
   without restarting the server.  Perhaps you don't need
   refresh, since this operation is the *primary* cost of 
   startup and hence restarting may be sufficient.  
   One problem is dynamically adding a calculation for
   a user session or global definitions incrementally.
   Ability to update catalog on fly without restarting?

*Introspect*

   Do we need to introspect on every rebuild?  So in 1.0
   we started with a two-phase process.  The first phase,
   we introspected to make a catalog configuration file
   (in YAML) and second page, we used the configuration
   file to load without doing introspection again.  With 
   plugins we had other options. 
  
*Re-Introspection*

   If you cache introspection and/or attach configuration
   data to it, what happens when you re-introspect and
   a table is renamed, etc.  For PostgreSQL, you can know
   if a rename happened, since the pg_class OID is same;
   but this shouldn't be pg specific.

Missing Information
-------------------

Sometimes the information in an introspected catalog lacks
detail that a user would wish.  Perhaps it's not setup in the
database such as a missing foreign key constraint, or such
information isn't available such as MySQL's MyISAM that
completely lacks foreign keys.  It's also possible that
permissions arn't setup or are not a database feature. 

HTSQL uses candidate keys to provide deterministic output,
joining two instances of the same table for various query
construction needs.  A candidate key is defined as the primary
key, if it exists, of the first unique key where all columns
are not null.  If a candidate key is not provided, there is a
weak fallback: a listing of a table will order by all columns
and many query constructions become errors.  If the candidate
key is invalid (there is data that violates the constraint)
then the HTSQL processor will not behave properly.

HTSQL uses foreign keys to connect tables; where each foreign
key creates a forward and a backward link.  If the target of a
foreign key is a candidate key, the link is singular;
otherwise, it is assumed to be plural.  In HTSQL, link pairs
could also be arbitrary joins, partial associations where the 
links in both directions are plural.

Proposed Format
---------------

A proposed catalog format for providing missing & augmented
information (such as arbitrary non-foreign key joins).  It
could look something like::

  ---
  catalog.missing:
    unique-keys:
    - schema: foo
      table: bar
      columns: [ a, b ]
      is-primary: true
    foreign-keys:
    - origin:
        schema: foo
        table: source
        columns: [c1, c2]
      target:
	schema: foo
	table: dest
	columns: [d, e]
    not-null:
    - schema: foo
      table: bar
      columns: [c1, c2]
    restrict:
    - schema: skip_this_schema
    - schema: a_schema
      table: skip_this_table
    - schema: a_schema
      table: *
      columns: [_history, _last_updated]

An issue with this format is that arbitrary link pairs that
are either dirty, non-enforceable foreign keys or partial
link pairs (many-to-many) would be included in the foreign
key section, which is a bit misleading.

Naming Links
------------

For link from root scope to a given table, using the table
name works except in a few cases.  Trivial (and rare) case
is where the table name is not unique after normalization due
to collisions or two tables differing by schema.  Other cases
are multi-column foreign keys that can't be named after a
particular column.  Still other cases include ambiguous 
reverse links (by default named after the target table) where
there are two or more possible reverse links.  Finally, the
default link names simply may not be intuitive or helpful.

In these situations we need a way to provide names or override
the auto-generated names.   It's not clear at this point where
these would go in the configuration file.  Should they be a 
separate section? or should they augment foreign key detail?
