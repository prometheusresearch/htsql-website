In HTSQL, we'd like commands and functions to have the same syntax.
How do we make this work?

Background
----------

Currently formatters are handled as a special case, for
example, ``/school/:csv``.  We'd like this to be equivalent
(using postfix syntax) to ``/csv(/school)``.  Broadly speaking,
we'd like commands to have same syntax as functions.  The
challenge here is how to get from the internal syntax tree to
the WSGI output.  Is binding different?  What are the other
translation phases to get to the formatted output.  

Our previous approach (in 1.x) had a separate syntax for
commands and each command was responsible for translating it's
arguments into an output. We had command chaining via typed
pipeline.  Commands had input/output interface with a set of
types: SYNTAX (a syntax tree), PRODUCT (tabular output of an
SQL query), RENDER (WSGI output), among others. 

In this version, we need a pipeline support, but we should
assume that they would be supported by nested commands.  For
example, suppose we have a ``/meta()`` command that executes
its argument on the meta-data structure for the current
context.  Hence, ``/html(/meta(/column))`` would produce an
HTML formatted table listing columns currently available to 
the current user. This query could also be written in 
postfix syntax as ``/column/:meta/:html``.

So what happens after a syntax tree?  What is the result of 
the translation and how do we convert this to final output.
