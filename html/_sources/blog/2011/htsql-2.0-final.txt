Today we've tagged the final release of HTSQL 2.0 --- a high-level
query language and web service gateway for relational databases.
This release supports SQLite and PostgreSQL.  We wrote this tool
so that business analysts could actually use a database.

We're curious what you think.

Fixed since the release candidate:

* Merged `/:json` and `/:jsonex` renderers; use `/:jsonex` layout
  to avoid CSRF issues.
* Documentation updates.
