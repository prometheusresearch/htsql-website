We are a community project |mdash| we do *not* have a |lq| professional
|rq| version with proprietary features.  When technically feasible, all
features are made available for all open source databases.  We do license
HTSQL for use in conjunction with proprietary databases, but there is
*no* |lq| special sauce |rq|.

To collaborate with us, please read our covenant_.

Sponsorship & Support
=====================

We have lots of things we'd like HTSQL to do, and we're sure you do as
well.  Sponsoring features will help us get them done faster.  All
features developed through sponsorship are billed at a collaborative,
cost-based rate, or treated as donations to support work on HTSQL.
Sponsors are prominently listed on our homepage.

We are able to offer support agreements.  This is a retainer and
maintenance agreement that helps us keep technical staff focused on
continuously improving HTSQL and assisting your team with any issues
they may encounter.

If you are interested, please request a quote via our `web form

Contributions & Collaboration
=============================

We welcome free software collaborators.  Please subscribe to 
`htsql-users <http://lists.htsql.org/mailman/listinfo/htsql-users>`_
and join us at `#htsql <irc://irc.freenode.net#htsql>`_.

Since HTSQL uses a plugin mechanism for extensions, there is typically
no need for commit access to our repository, nor any reason to fork.
Further, when we prepare our *free software* distribution we seek to
include 3rd party extensions that do not otherwise require *non-free*
component parts.  Our project is governed such that improvements are
considered based upon technical merit.  We will not withhold our own
features to release them in a proprietary version of this work.

Direction and growth of this project is currently subject to our own
application requirements and funding.  However, it must instead become a
function of adoption, including community contributions and financial
revenue from feature sponsorship_, technical support_, or `licensing
</license/#proprietary>`_ of HTSQL for proprietary database systems.

For works that we would incorporate into our repository, we do require
intellectual property assignment.  In exchange, we give our word as a
open source covenant that we will maintain this work and not take it
soley proprietary with your contributions; else, we will release this
entire work under the Apache license if future support is not
forthcoming.  We do not have a contribution agreement yet prepared, but
when needed, we intend to model it after the Contributor Agreement,
described by Bruce Perens'
`The Covenant - A New Approach to Open Source Cooperation 
<http://hpccsystems.com/community/white-papers/the_covenant_bperens>`_.
