|n1| What constitutes a derivative work necessarily depends upon the
specifics of the situation and legal interpretation.  Private works
which are not made available to the public do not fall under the terms
of the AGPL's copyleft provisions and therefore may remain proprietary.

|n2| We do not sell |lq| proprietary addons |rq|.  All features are
included in the free_ and permissive_ licensed versions of HTSQL, to
the extent that those features could work with open source databases.

Our repository distribution includes evaluation_ adapters for proprietary
databases, such as Oracle or Micrososoft SQL Server.  We offer HTSQL with
the intent to sell proprietary_ licenses for use of HTSQL in conjunction
with commercially licensed databases.

In our repository distribution, some components considered broadly useful,
but ancillary to HTSQL itself, are released under the MIT license.
Example code snippets, configuration, and applications are placed into
the public domain using the CC0 copyright dedication.  These exceptions
to the general license outline above are marked on a file by file basis.

.. _Permissive:

HTSQL Permissive License
========================

This license option permits any sort of distribution, modification, and
usage of HTSQL in conjunction open source databases.  In particular, we
explicitly allow proprietary applications to use HTSQL in conjunction
with PostgreSQL and SQLite.

.. _Free:

HTSQL Free Software License
===========================

HTSQL may be used, modified, and/or deployed subject to the AGPLv3_ with a
supplemental term requiring author attribution in an "About Box" or similar
feature.  This `free software`_ license ensures user's freedom to run, copy,
share, study, change and improve this software by requiring publicly
available derivative works are, *as a whole*, compatibly licensed.

    Copyright (c) 2006-2012 Prometheus Research, LLC.
    All rights reserved.

    This program is free software: you can use, redistribute, and/or modify
    it under the terms of the GNU Affero General Public License, version 3
    or later ("AGPL"), as published by the Free Software Foundation, and as
    supplemented by additional terms according to section 7 of the AGPL:

    This Program was created by members and contributors to the HTSQL
    Project (http://htsql.org).  As permitted by section 7b of the AGPL,
    we require preservation of copyright notices and author attributions
    in this Program's documentation and Appropriate Legal Notices.  This
    Program displays such notices in its "htsql-ctl version" command line
    option, and also in its "About HTSQL" dialog box.  In the graphical
    display of these notices, author attributions include "Powered By"
    logos for HTSQL and for other software projects.

    For works containing this Program or any covered work, each interactive
    user interface must include a prominent and conveniently accessible
    feature for the display of Appropriate Legal Notices.  This display
    must include author attributions and copyright notices as found in this
    Program.  This display of these author attributions must be convenient
    for a user wishing to browse credits, shown in a manner separate and
    distinct from license texts, and commensurately prominent with respect
    to other author attributions.  To the extent that it is technically
    feasible and not obtrusive, the graphical form of these author
    attributions, such as a "Powered By" logo, must be preserved;
    otherwise, a textual equivalent is permitted.

    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the
    GNU Affero General Public License for more details.

    You should have received a copy of the GNU Affero General Public License
    along with this program.  If not, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.

    Additional permissions, which may be removed at your option, under
    GNU AGPL version 3 section 7:

    If you modify this Program, or any covered work, by linking or combining
    it with parts that are otherwise independent works covered by the terms
    of GNU GPL version 2, the licensors of this Program grant you additional
    permission to convey the entire combined work containing those parts.


In offering the HTSQL under the AGPLv3, we see any HTSQL plugin or extension
as having intimate communication with HTSQL itself and understand them to be
modifications that create covered works subject to the copyleft requirements
of the AGPLv3.  Specifically, we consider adapters or addon features usable
*only* in conjunction with a proprietary database system, database extension,
or web service to be *non-free*.  Conveyance of, or remote network interaction
with, such covered works is incompatible with this free software license since
the *whole work* is not included |mdash| a proprietary license is effectively
required for a user to operate the covered work.


.. _Evaluation:

HTSQL Evaluation License
========================

This is limited distribution and use license for proprietary database adapters
so that they may be publicly shared and evaluated.  We require a proprietary_
license for any commercial use.

::

    Copyright (c) 2006-2012 Prometheus Research, LLC.
    All rights reserved.

    This license is meant for the express purpose of permitting public
    evaluation (but not commercial use) of proprietary database adapters.
    By distributing, installing, modifying, or using this software you
    agree to be bound to the terms of this agreement.

    Limited redistribution and use, as well as the creation of Derivative
    Works, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met:

    1. The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be
    included in all copies or substantial portions of this software.

    2. You may only use this software for evaluation purposes, which are
    limited to: the discovery of how HTSQL works, testing of function or
    performance, the creation of prototype applications used for
    demonstrations, and communicating bug reports and/or feature requests.

    3. You may not use or distribute this software, or any Derivative
    Work, in any form for commercial purposes.  Examples of commercial
    purposes would be running business operations, licensing, leasing,
    or selling this software, or distributing this software for use
    with commercial products or services.

    4. You may distribute this software or Derivative Works, provided
    that such copies of this software or Derivative Works are licensed
    under this HTSQL Evaluation License.

    By "Derivative Work" we mean any derivative work under U.S. copyright
    law (or, for distribution or use outside the United States, the most
    closely equivalent concept under applicable law), including, without
    limitation, any improvement, translation, transformation, adaptation,
    modification, arrangement, plugin, wrapper, shim, or extension based
    on this software.

    THIS SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED BY AUTHOR AND CONTRIBUTORS "AS IS" AND ANY
    EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE
    IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, AGAINST INFRINGEMENT, TITLE AND
    FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE ARE DISCLAIMED. IN NO EVENT SHALL
    AUTHOR OR CONTRIBUTORS BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL,
    SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING, BUT NOT
    LIMITED TO, PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE GOODS OR SERVICES; LOSS OF USE,
    DATA, OR PROFITS; OR BUSINESS INTERRUPTION) HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY
    THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT
    (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE
    OF THIS SOFTWARE, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE.


.. _Proprietary:

HTSQL Proprietary License
=========================

We will offer proprietary licenses specifically to distribute and use
HTSQL in conjunction with a proprietary database system, or to distribute 
works based upon HTSQL that require a *non-free* component.  At this time, 
we don't have this license prepared, but the principle is that we are 
*selling* an exception to our free_ software license so that HTSQL can be 
combined with a proprietary database system.
