<p>† What constitutes a derivative work necessarily depends upon the
specifics of the situation and legal interpretation.  Private works
which are not made available to the public do not fall under the terms
of the AGPL&#8217;s copyleft provisions and therefore may remain proprietary.</p>
<p>‡ We do not sell “proprietary addons”.  All features are
included in the <a class="reference internal" href="#free">free</a> and <a class="reference internal" href="#permissive">permissive</a> licensed versions of HTSQL, to
the extent that those features could work with open source databases.</p>
<p>Our repository distribution includes <a class="reference internal" href="#evaluation">evaluation</a> adapters for proprietary
databases, such as Oracle or Micrososoft SQL Server.  We offer HTSQL with
the intent to sell <a class="reference internal" href="#proprietary">proprietary</a> licenses for use of HTSQL in conjunction
with commercially licensed databases.</p>
<p>In our repository distribution, some components considered broadly useful,
but ancillary to HTSQL itself, are released under the MIT license.
Example code snippets, configuration, and applications are placed into
the public domain using the CC0 copyright dedication.  These exceptions
to the general license outline above are marked on a file by file basis.</p>

<p>This license option permits any sort of distribution, modification, and
usage of HTSQL in conjunction open source databases.  In particular, we
explicitly allow proprietary applications to use HTSQL in conjunction
with PostgreSQL and SQLite.</p>

supplemented by additional terms according to section 7 of the AGPL:

This Program was created by members and contributors to the HTSQL
Project (http://htsql.org).  As permitted by section 7b of the AGPL,
we require preservation of copyright notices and author attributions
in this Program's documentation and Appropriate Legal Notices.  This
Program displays such notices in its "htsql-ctl version" command line
option, and also in its "About HTSQL" dialog box.  In the graphical
display of these notices, author attributions include "Powered By"
logos for HTSQL and for other software projects.

For works containing this Program or any covered work, each interactive
user interface must include a prominent and conveniently accessible
feature for the display of Appropriate Legal Notices.  This display
must include author attributions and copyright notices as found in this
Program.  This display of these author attributions must be convenient
for a user wishing to browse credits, shown in a manner separate and
distinct from license texts, and commensurately prominent with respect
to other author attributions.  To the extent that it is technically
feasible and not obtrusive, the graphical form of these author
attributions, such as a "Powered By" logo, must be preserved;
otherwise, a textual equivalent is permitted.

This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of

You should have received a copy of the GNU Affero General Public License

Additional permissions, which may be removed at your option, under
GNU AGPL version 3 section 7:

If you modify this Program, or any covered work, by linking or combining
it with parts that are otherwise independent works covered by the terms
of GNU GPL version 2, the licensors of this Program grant you additional
permission to convey the entire combined work containing those parts.</pre>
</div>
<p>In offering the HTSQL under the AGPLv3, we see any HTSQL plugin or extension
as having intimate communication with HTSQL itself and understand them to be
modifications that create covered works subject to the copyleft requirements
of the AGPLv3.  Specifically, we consider adapters or addon features usable
<em>only</em> in conjunction with a proprietary database system, database extension,
or web service to be <em>non-free</em>.  Conveyance of, or remote network interaction
with, such covered works is incompatible with this free software license since
the <em>whole work</em> is not included — a proprietary license is effectively
required for a user to operate the covered work.</p>
